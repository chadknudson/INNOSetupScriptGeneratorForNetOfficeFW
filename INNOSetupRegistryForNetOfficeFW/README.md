The INNO Setup [^1] Generator for NetOfficeFw[^2] helps to get you started on creating an installer for your NetOfficeFw AddIn. 

The tool was cobbled together borrowing HEAVILY from the NetOfficeFw.Build project. 

You can simply clone this project on your local dev machine, build it, and run it with two parameters on the command line -- the first parameter being the full path to your release AddIn .DLL file, and the second is a comma separated list of Office applications that your AddIn supports.

Thank you goes out to Jozef Izso for all his work on NetOfficeFw and NetOfficeFw.BuildTasks!
